# WEkEO-4-Atmosphere-Monitoring-2025
I participated in the WEkEO 4 Atmosphere Monitoring workshop in March 2025, focusing on using Jupyter Notebooks for atmospheric data analysis. We worked with a dedicated notebook through WEkEO Jupyter Hub, requiring prior registration. The workshop included a tutorial and a demonstration video by experts.
