I participated in the **WEkEO 4 Atmosphere Monitoring** workshop held in **March 2025**. This workshop focused on the use of **Jupyter Notebooks** for data analysis in the field of atmospheric monitoring. 

For the practical part, we used a **Jupyter Notebook** specifically designed for the workshop, accessible via the **WEkEO Jupyter Hub** environment, which required prior registration on the **WEkEO** platform. 

The workshop also featured a detailed tutorial and a full demonstration video prepared by experts, showcasing the application of Notebooks for atmospheric data analysis.
